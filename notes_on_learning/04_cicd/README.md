## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

- measure time
- lead time and deployment frequency
- do not let flaky tests get to your pipeline
- e.g., for gitlab or other tool that spawns docker per job, keep the job number to minium
- k8s state in git repo
- info about premature tool extraction
- interfajs between dev and op
- conventions over tools! - https://github.com/wojciech12/talk_bitconf_best_practices_introducing_k8s_and_CN/blob/master/slides.pdf
